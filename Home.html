      <h2>What is biodiversity conservation? </h2>
    <p>Biodiversity conservation is the protection and management of biodiversity to obtain resources for sustainable development. <br>

        Biodiversity conservation has three main objectives: <br> <br>
        
        1. To preserve the diversity of species. <br>
        2. Sustainable utilization of species and ecosystem. <br>
        3. To maintain life-supporting systems and essential ecological processes. <br> <br>
        The variability of life on Earth is called Biodiversity. <br> Biodiversity takes into account all the living organisms present on Earth. <br> Healthy and good biodiversity indicate a healthy and good ecosystem. Hence, biodiversity is very important. <br> A healthy ecosystem also includes the availability of pure water, pure air, healthy land, a good climate, and the availability of nutrients on Earth. <br> Therefore, biodiversity conservation plays an important role in the quality of life of all living organisms. <br><br>


        The protection and management of biodiversity in obtaining sustainable development of resources are called Biodiversity conservation. <br><br>
        
        
        There are three major objectives of Biodiversity conservation: <br><br>
        
       > Preservation of the diversity of species. <br><br>
        
       > Sustainability of species and ecosystem. <br><br>
        
       > Maintaining life-supporting and essential ecological processes</p>

        <div class="bio2"><h3>Biodiversity and its Conservation Methods.</h3>
          <p>Biodiversity refers to the variability of life on earth. It can be conserved in the following ways: <br>
  
              1-In-situ Conservation<br>
              2-Ex-situ Conservation
              </p> 
              <h3>In-situ Conservation</h3>
              
  <p>In-situ conservation of biodiversity is the conservation of species within their natural habitat. In this method, the natural ecosystem is maintained and protected. <br><br>
  
  The in-situ conservation has several advantages. Following are the important advantages of in-situ conservation: <br><br>
  
  It is a cost-effective and convenient method of conserving biodiversity. <br>
  A large number of living organisms can be conserved simultaneously. <br>
  Since the organisms are in a natural ecosystem, they can evolve better and can easily adjust to different environmental conditions. <br>
  Certain protected areas where in-situ conservation takes place include national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and biosphere reserves. <br><br>
  
  National Parks <br>
  These are small reserves maintained by the government. Its boundaries are well demarcated and human activities such as grazing, forestry, habitat and cultivation are prohibited. For eg., Kanha National Park, and Bandipur National Park. <br><br>
  
  Wildlife Sanctuaries <br>
  These are the regions where only wild animals are found. Human activities such as timber harvesting, cultivation, collection of woods and other forest products are allowed here as long as they do not interfere with the conservation project. Also, tourists visit these places for recreation. <br><br>
  
 
<h4>Biosphere Reserves</h4> 

These are national governments nominated sites, large areas (often up to 5000 square km) of an ecosystem where the traditional lifestyle and natural habitat of the inhabitants of that ecosystem are protected. They are mostly open to tourists and researchers. <br><br>


Example- Sundarban, Nanda Devi, Nokrek, and Manas in India. <br><br>


National Parks
These are limited reserves maintained by the government for the conservation of wildlife as well as the environment. <br> Human activities are prohibited in national parks and they are solely dedicated to the protection of natural fauna of the area. <br> They mostly occupy an area of 100-500 square km. <br> There are a total of 104 national parks in India, right now. <br> The national parks may even be within a biosphere reserve. <br> These are small reserves that are protected and maintained by the government. Its boundaries are well protected, where human activities such as grazing, forestry, habitat, and cultivation are restricted.  <br><br>


Example- Kanha National Park, Gir National Park, Kaziranga National Park, and so on. <br><br>


<h5>Wildlife Sanctuaries</h5>

Wildlife Sanctuaries are protected areas meant only for the conservation of wild animals. <br> A few human activities such as cultivation, wood collection, and other forest product collection are allowed here, but they must not interfere with the conservation of the animals. <br> Tourist visits are also allowed in these areas. <br> There are a total of 551 wildlife sanctuaries in India. <br> These are the places where only wild animals can be found. <br> Certain human activities like timber harvesting, cultivation, collection of woods, and other forest products are permitted unless they interfere with the conservation project. <br> Recreation tourism is also permitted. <br><br>


Example- Ghana Bird Sanctuary, Abohar Wildlife Sanctuary, Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary, etc.


<h5>Biodiversity Hotspots</h5>
A biodiversity hotspot are the areas of conservation where there is strictly a minimum of 1500 species of vascular plants and a habitat that has lost its 70% cover. <br> These are protected areas for various purposes where the wildlife, inhabitant lifestyle, and domesticated plants and animals are conserved. <br> Tourist and research activities are allowed. <br><br>


Example- The Himalayas, The Western Ghats, The North East, and The Nicobar Islands.

<h5>Gene Sanctuary</h5>
Gene sanctuary is a conservation area reserved only for plants. <br> India has its only gene sanctuary set up in Garo Hills of Meghalaya for the conservation of wild species of Citrus. <br> Plans to open more such sanctuaries are underway. <br><br>

<h5>Sacred Groves</h5>
Sacred Groves are conserved areas for wildlife protected by communities due to religious beliefs. <br> It is mostly a part of the forest where its wildlife is given complete protection.

<div class="bio3">
  <h3>Ex-situ Conservation
  </h3>
  <p>Ex-situ conservation of biodiversity involves the breeding and maintenance of endangered species in artificial ecosystems such as zoos, nurseries, botanical gardens, gene banks, etc. There is less competition for food, water and space among the organisms. <br><br>
  
      Ex-situ conservation has the following advantages: <br><br>
      
      The animals are provided with a longer time and breeding activity. <br>
      The species bred in captivity can be reintroduced in the wild. <br>
      Genetic techniques can be used for the preservation of endangered species. <br>
      ***Advantages of Ex Situ Conservation Include*** <br>
  1. Essential life-sustaining conditions like climate, food availability, veterinary care can be altered and are under human control. <br><br>
  
  2. Artificial breeding methods can be introduced leading to successful breeding and creating many more offspring of the species. <br><br>
  
  3. The species can be protected from poaching and population management can be efficiently done. <br><br>
  
  4. Gene techniques can be applied to increase the population of the species and they can again be reintroduced into the wild.

      <h3>Strategies for Biodiversity Conservation</h3>
      <p>Following are the important strategies for biodiversity conservation: <br><br>
  
         1. All the varieties of food, timber plants, livestock, microbes and agricultural animals should be conserved. <br>
         2.  All the economically important organisms should be identified and conserved. <br>
         3.  Unique ecosystems should be preserved first. <br>
         4. The resources should be utilized efficiently. <br>
         5. Poaching and hunting of wild animals should be prevented. <br>
         6. The reserves and protected areas should be developed carefully. <br>
         7. The levels of pollutants should be reduced in the environment. <br>
         8.  Deforestation should be strictly prohibited. <br>
         9. Environmental laws should be followed strictly. <br>
         10. The useful and endangered species of plants and animals should be conserved in their nature as well as artificial habitats. <br>
          Public awareness should be created regarding biodiversity conservation and its importance.
          <br><br>
          <h4>Biodiversity Conservation Strategies</h4>
  Conservation of Ecosystems- The intent of the conservation of biodiversity is to provide long term viability to the ecosystems. It is to make sure that ecological integrity is intact. The landscapes of the region which have undergone historical or evolutionary deterioration can be reinstated. The threats can be removed and the ecosystems should be able to continue with ecological processes. 
  
  Reverse the decline of species- According to this strategy, the aim of conservation is to restore the population of declined species in a particular ecosystem. 
  
  Conservation of all biological aspects- This strategy aims at giving cover and conserving food, livestock, microbial population, agricultural stock including plants and animals.
  
  Efficient utilization of natural resources.
  
  Strict laws on deforestation and preventions of deforestation by every means.
  
  Poaching and killing animals in the wild should be prevented.
  
  Creating public awareness about conservation of biodiversity and its importance. 
  
  Longer time and breeding activity of the animals are provided.
  
  The breeding of species in captivity is reintroduced in the wild.
  
  Genetic techniques are used to preserve endangered species.

          <h3>Why should you conserve Biodiversity?</h3>
          <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1504204861825-22dd11027823?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=870&q=80" alt="">
          <p>It is believed that an area with higher species abundance has a more stable environment compared to an area with lower species abundance. <br> We can further claim the necessity of biodiversity by considering our degree of dependency on the environment. <br> We depend directly on various species of plants for our various needs. <br> Similarly, we depend on various species of animals and microbes for different reasons.
              <br>
              Biodiversity is being lost due to the loss of habitat, over-exploitation of resources, climatic changes, pollution, invasive exotic species, diseases, hunting, etc. <br> Since it provides us with several economic and ethical benefits and adds aesthetic value, it is very important to conserve biodiversity.</p>
              <p><h3>Need for Biodiversity Conservation</h3>
                Various types of conservation methods ensure a healthy ecosystem. <br> A healthy ecosystem means a clean and healthy environment, smooth running food chains, availability of resources, and so on. <br>
                
                
                Human beings are also majorly dependent on the environment for basic necessities and wellbeing. <br> We are interdependent on a variety of species of plants and animals for a living. <br> Hence it is very important to conserve these species and their ecosystems which are threatened by many human activities. <br>
                
                
                A threat to biodiversity poses a threat to humankind. <br> It can be the cause of various grave problems like pollution, habitat loss, resource exploitation, climate change, species extinction, disease outbreak, and so on.
                
                
                For economic and various life support reasons, it is very important to protect and preserve biodiversity. <br><br>
                
                
                <h4>Strategies for Biodiversity Conservation</h4> 
                Following are some of the important strategies for biodiversity conservation: <br><br>
                
                1. Conservation of all food varieties, timber plants, livestock, microbes, and agricultural animals should be done. <br>
                
                2. Identification and conservation of all the economically important organisms should be done.
                
                3. Preservation of unique ecosystems should be done.
                
                4. Efficient utilization of resources should be done.
                
                5. Prevention of poaching and hunting of wild animals should be done.
                
                6. Development of the reserves and protected areas should be done carefully.
                
                7. Reduction in the levels of pollutants should be done on the environment.
                
                8. Prohibition of deforestation should be followed.
                
                9. Strict environmental laws should be followed.
                
                10.Conservation of useful and endangered species of plants and animals should be done.
                
                
               <h4>Reason for Conservation of Biodiversity</h4> 
                An area with higher abundant species has a more stable environment when compared to a lower species abundance area. <br> Humans directly depend on different species of plants for numerous needs. <br> Similarly, people depend on various animals and microbes for different reasons. <br><br>
                
                
                Due to various reasons such as the loss of habitat, over-exploitation of resources, climatic changes, pollution, invasive exotic species, diseases, hunting, etc biodiversity is being lost. <br> It is very important to conserve biodiversity as it provides various economic and ethical benefits and adds aesthetic value</p>
